Hi, this is a mini-project that is a webpage that replicates an Etch-a-sketch with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Here are some of the features I included within this project:
1. Designate how many squares should be included in the canvas for higher resolution drawings
2. A switch for a brush that allows you to color with random colors.
3. A switch that makes it so that your brush gradually becomes darker as you draw.
